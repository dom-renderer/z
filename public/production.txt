. Before Morning Shift Starts (Order Sheet Upload)
Orders from shops / customers are already prepared in another software and come as a ready file (order sheet).
Office staff goes to the Order Upload Screen in our system.
Here the Date and Shift = Morning will be pre-selected by default.
Staff does not need to change date or shift.
Staff simply uploads the ready Order Sheet file.
The system automatically calculates for each product:
Total Orders = Sales Order Quantity + Indent Quantity (read directly from the sheet)
Opening Stock (Morning) = always ZERO (for the morning shift, opening stock is always 0, without exception)
So Production Required = Total Orders – Opening Stock = Total Orders
This way, the full production plan for the morning shift is ready: how much to produce for each item.
🧁 2. During the Morning Shift (For Bakers)
Bakers open the tablet screen.
Today’s Date and Shift = Morning are already pre-selected.
Bakers cannot change the date or shift.
If anything needs to be changed, only the Administrator can do it from the backend.
On the tablet they see a simple list of products, for example:
Product Name
Size
Production Required (total pieces to make in this shift)
Produced (pieces made so far)
Remaining To Produce (how many pieces are still pending)
Bakers will continuously update production:
As soon as one cake / one batch is finished, they enter that quantity under “Produced”.
Example: “Black Forest 500g – Produced: 5 pcs”.
As soon as they enter the quantity:
The system automatically reduces that quantity from Remaining To Produce, and
Automatically increases the Produced quantity.
At the top, a doughnut chart / progress indicator will show:
The Total Production Required for the whole shift
How much has been Produced so far
In the center, a big message like:
“Shift Progress: 70% completed”
This gives both the office and bakers a live idea of how much of the shift’s work is completed.
✅ 3. End of the Morning Shift
At the end of the shift, bakers make sure that:
Produced quantity is correctly updated for every product.
For the morning shift, the system shows a summary for each product:
Production Required
Produced
Remaining To Produce
The system calculates Closing Stock (Morning) based on what was produced
(since Morning Opening Stock is always 0, Closing Stock simply equals total produced for that product, internally managed by the system).
As per your rule:
Night Shift Opening Stock = Morning Shift Closing Stock
So whatever is ready and left at the end of the morning shift becomes the Opening Stock for the Night Shift (for the same day).
🌙 4. Night Shift
The Order Sheet for the Night Shift also comes as a ready file from the other software.
Office staff again goes to the upload screen for the Night Shift:
Here, Date and Shift = Night will also be pre-selected.
Staff only has to upload the Night Shift Order Sheet.
The system automatically calculates for each product:
Opening Stock (Night) = Morning Shift Closing Stock (linked automatically)
Total Orders (Night) = Sales + Indent (from the uploaded sheet)
Production Required (Night) = Total Orders (Night) – Opening Stock (Night)
For Night Shift, bakers use the same tablet screen:
Today’s Date and Shift = Night are pre-selected –
they cannot change them (only admin can from backend).
The list shows:
Product Name, Size, Production Required, Produced, Remaining To Produce
They also continuously update production during the night shift, just like morning.
At the end of the night shift, the system shows a closing summary:
Production Required, Produced, Remaining To Produce for each product.
🔁 5. Next Day Morning Logic (Opening Stock Rule)
There will be a simple rule in the system:
For every new day’s Morning Shift, Opening Stock will always be ZERO for all products, with no exceptions.
This means:
Last night’s Closing Stock is not carried forward to the next day’s morning opening stock.
For the next morning, the system will again treat:
Opening Stock = 0, and
Production Required = Total Orders (from the new morning order sheet).
As per your instruction:
There will be no dispatch tracking in the system.
There will be no dispatch entries or dispatch screens.
We will only track Orders and Production (Required, Produced, Remaining).
